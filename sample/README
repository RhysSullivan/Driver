Intro
-----

This example consists of two parts:
  - ASCII character device driver
  - Driver test program

EMPLOY EXTREME CAUTION when playing with this.
It's not a production quality 'software'.
NOT recommended to use on systems with important
data or tasks.

Installation and Execution
--------------------------

To install compile first:

$ make

Then register an ASCII driver:

$ make register

For the latter to succeed you have to have root
privileges and not to have module called 'ascii'.
Otherwise, you'll have to tweak the Makefile.

If you don't want debugging messages, also tweak
the Makefile.

To run the test program type:
$ ./ascii-test
